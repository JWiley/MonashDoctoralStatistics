# Missing Data:  Multiple Imputation

Missing data are very common, but also problematic

- Results from the non-missing data may be biased
- Missing data cause a loss of efficiency

The easiest approach to "address" missing data is to only analyse
complete cases (i.e., list-wise deletion). This often leads to
inefficiency (e.g., discarding data on X and Z because observation on
variable Y are missing). Also, list wise deletion may bias results
unless the data are missing completely at random (MCAR).

Missing data often are classified:

- Missing completely at random (MCAR) when the missingness mechanism
is completely independent of the estimate of our parameter(s) of interest
- Missing at random (MAR) when the missingness mechanism is
*conditionally* independent of the estimate of our parameter(s) of interest
- Missing not at random (MNAR) when the missingness mechanism is
associated with the estimate of our parameter(s) of interest

Our parameters may be anything, such as a mean, a standard deviation,
a regression coefficient, etc. We will explore **multiple imputation
(MI)** as one robust way to address missing data.

## Multiple Imputation (MI) Theory

Multiple imputation is one robust way to address missing data. It
involves generate multiple, different datasets where in each one,
different, plausible values are imputed for the missing data,
resulting in each imputed dataset have "complete" data since missing
data are filled in by predictions.

As the problem with missing data is very generic and impacts every
statistic, even the most basic decriptive statistics, we need a
general language for talking about it.

- Let $Q$ be some population value (e.g., a mean, a regression
  coefficient).
- Let $\hat{Q}$ be an estimate of $Q$ with some estimate of
  uncertainty due to sampling variation, calculated typically in each
  imputed dataset.
- Let $\bar{Q}$ be the average of a set of estimates, $\hat{Q}$ across
  different imputed datasets, with some estimate of uncertainty both
  due to sampling variation impacting $\hat{Q}$ and missing data
  uncertainty (causing variation in $\hat{Q}$ from one imputed dataset
  to the next.

We will not discuss how to estimate $\hat{Q}$ as this is specific to
the analysis being performed (e.g., mean, regression coefficient, mean
difference from t-test, etc.). It does not really matter for the
purpose of MI. All we need is an estimate and (valid) standard error.

The general steps in MI are as follows:

1. Start with the incomplete data (the raw dataset with missing
   data).
2. Generate $m$ datasets with no missingness, by filling in *different*
   plausible values for any missing data. We will discuss this more
   later.
3. Perform the analysis of interest on **each** imputed dataset. That
   is, the analysis of interest is repeated $m$ times. This generates
   $m$ different $\hat{Q}$ estimates and associated standard errors.
4. Pool the results from the analyses run on each imputed dataset to
   generate an overall estimate, $\bar{Q}$.


Previously in statistics, we have grown accustomed to reporting
$\hat{Q}$, whether that be a mean, correlation, regression
coefficient, or any other statistic of interest. With missing data
addressed using MI, we instead report $\bar{Q}$, which is defined as:

$$\bar{Q} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i = 1}^{m}\hat{Q}_{i}$$

This is simply the average of the $\hat{Q}$ estimates from each
individual imputed dataset. What is more unique and forms an important
difference between multiple imputation and other simpler methods
(e.g., single mean imputation) is the variance estimate.

Let $\hat{V}_{i}$ be the variance estimate (e.g., squared standard
error) for the $ith$ imputed dataset for $\hat{Q}_{i}$. Then:

$$\bar{V} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i = 1}^{m}\hat{V}_{i}$$

$\bar{V}$ is the average uncertainty estimate of $\hat{Q}$ across the
multiply imputed datasets.

However, there is another source of uncertainty in our estimate of 
$\bar{Q}$. The between imputed dataset variation, which is:

$$B = \frac{1}{m - 1}\sum_{i = 1}^{m}(\hat{Q}_{i} - \bar{Q})^2$$

$B$ captures the variance in the estimates, $\hat{Q}$. Because the
observed, non-missing data never change from one imputed dataset to
another, the only reason that $\hat{Q}$ will change is when the
plausible values imputed for the missing data change. Thus $B$ is an
estimate of the uncertainty in $\bar{Q}$ due to missing data.

Finally, for practical reasons we do not generate an infinite number
of imputed datasets. We could simply continue multiply imputing more
datasets, but this takes additional time. Because of this we do not
have the *population* of imputed datasets, instead we have a (random)
sample of all possible multiply imputed datasets. This results in some
simulation error which is added to the uncertainty in our $\bar{Q}$
estimate. Specifically, this uncertainty is:

$$\frac{B}{m}$$

Now we finally have all the pieces to determine what the total
uncertainty in our average estimate, $\bar{Q}$ is:

$$T = \bar{V} + B + \frac{B}{m}$$

Practically, this can be thought of as: the uncertainty in the
estimate of our statistic of interest from multiply imputed data,
$\bar{Q}$ is due to: (1) sampling variation $\bar{V}$, (2) uncertainty
in how we imputed the missing data $B$, and (3) uncertainty because we
did not generate an infinite number of imputed datasets,
$\frac{B}{m}$. One implication is that we can reduce the uncertainty
somewhat, simply by generating more imputed datasets. However, this
yields diminishing returns and slows analysis (remember, the analysis
of interest must be run separately **on each imputed dataset**.  100
imputed datasets would mean running an analysis 100 times, which takes
more than running it for, say, 20 imputed datasets. In most cases,
with modern computers, people recommend 25 - 100 imputed datasets now.

## Multiple Imputation Steps

The general process to generate multiply imputed using a robust
approach: fully conditional specification (FCS) or multiple imputation
through chained equations (mice) is:

1. Start with a raw dataset with missing data
2. Fill in the missing data values with **initial** estimates[^initial].
3. For each variable that has missing data, build a prediction model
from other variables[^predictionmodel].
4. Use the model to predict the missing data[^fillmissing].
5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the predicted complete dataset does not
vary within some tolerance from one iteration to the next, indicating
convergence.

[^initial]: The first "fill in" estimates are generally fast and easy
to generate. For example, fill in missing using the median for each
variable or even random numbers within the observed data range.

[^predictionmodel]: Typically, all other variables in the dataset
being imputed are used in the prediction model, but it is possible to
use a subset. The most common case is to use Generalized Linear Models
(GLMs) as the prediction model, so linear regression for continuous
outcomes, logistic regression for binary outcomes, etc. However, any
prediction model can be used, including more complex methods such as
machine learning.

[^fillmissing]: At this step, the average / best prediction from the
model is used without capturing uncertainty. That is because this is
the dataset used to build the "final" model for actually imputing the
missing data. While we want uncertainty in our imputations, we do not
want the uncertainty in the data used to build the imputation model.

These steps may be easier to understand with a concrete example. Here
we setup a small dataset with age and inflammation.

```{r}

set.seed(12345)
x <- data.frame(Age = sort(round(runif(10, 30, 65))))
x$Inflammation <-  rnorm(10, x$Age/10, sd = .2)
x$Missing <- as.logical(rep(FALSE:TRUE, c(9, 1)))

scatterp <- ggplot(x, aes(Age, Inflammation)) +
    stat_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE) + 
    geom_point(aes(colour = Missing, size = Missing)) +
    theme_classic() + theme(legend.position = c(.8, .2))

print(scatterp)

## create a missing dataset
y <- x
y$Inflammation[y$Missing] <- NA

```

Here is a for loop that iterates through filling in missing values,
first using the median and then based on linear regression.
The graphs following show the scatter plots with the filled in missing
value at the first iteration and then later iterations[^iterconverge].
Watch how the imputed missing value changes from one iteration to the
next and how with later iterations, the amount of change gets
smaller and smaller.

[^iterconverge]: The goal behind iterating is to build a prediction
    model to impute the missing data. However, building that model in
    the first place is difficult when the data on which the model
    would be built are (partially) missing. To deal with this, we
    iterate between predicting the missing data and (re)building a
    model on the new dataset, now that missingness has been imputed.
	Multiple iterations are required because every time we generate new
    predictions to fill in the missing data, the dataset on which the
    prediction model was built changes, so we must rebuild the
    prediction model using the latest iteration of the dataset. This
    process is repeated until the change from one iteration to the
    next is very small. At that point, we say the results have
    **converged**.

```{r}

## create an imputed dataset
yimp <- y
p <- vector("list", length = 10)
imps <- vector("numeric", length = 10)

for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i == 1) {
    imps[i] <- median(y$Inflammation, na.rm = TRUE)
  } else if (i > 1) {
    m <- lm(Inflammation ~ Age, data = yimp)
    imps[i] <- fitted(m)[yimp$Missing]
  }
  yimp$Inflammation[yimp$Missing == TRUE] <- imps[i]
  p[[i]] <- scatterp %+% yimp + ggtitle(sprintf("Iteration = %d", i))
}

print(p[[1]])
print(p[[2]])
print(p[[3]])
print(p[[4]])

```

We can print out the imputed values too and see how those change. This
highlights how over iterations, there are big changes at first, and
with more iterations the changes are smaller and smaller. This is what
is meant by convergence where you converge to a final, stable value.
We could keep going by at some point we are close enough, we can stop.
We might decide,say, that once it does not change beyond the 2nd
decimal place, we stop.

```{r}

print(imps, digits = 5)

```

This gets us through Steps 2 to 5. The final step is to use those
final models to impute missing data[^imputemissing],
generating the desired number of imputed datasets (e.g., 100).

[^imputemissing]: This can be a rather complex step. Generating the
average prediction from, say, a linear regression is straight
forward. However, that average prediction does not take into account
that the linear regression model is uncertain in its prediction. To
take uncertainty into account, from parametric models like linear
regression, we draw random values from the predicted distribution. In
the case of linear regression that is: a normal distribution with mean
equal to the average prediction and standard deviation equal to the
residual standard deviation. This both takes the model into account
but also by using the residual standard deviation and drawing random
numbers, we ensure that when generating multiple imputed datasets, we
don't pretend we can fill in missing data values perfectly. We fill
them in with some error / uncertainty, which is important for the MI
to generate accurate standard errors, confidence intervals and
p-values. For non-parametric models, such as random forest machine
learning  models, we do not have an assumed distribution so we cannot
draw random values from a distribution with some mean and standard
deviation estimate. Instead, uncertainty in predictions must be
captured in other ways, such as via bootstrapping. However, the
details of this are beyond the scope of this lecture. Finally, when
doing Bayesian modeling, the predicted values for missing data are
very easily drawn from the posterior distribution. A fact that means
its fairly common for MI to be implemented within a Bayesian
framework, even if behind the scenes.

Often, the prediction models are generalized linear models (GLMs),
such as linear regression. GLMs are familiar and fast, but there are
drawbacks.

- GLMs assume linear relationships on the scale of the link
function. This can be problematic for MI as if you are imputing, say,
50 variables it is very time consuming to manually check whether the
assumption is met.
- GLMs only include interactions between variables when specified by
the analyst. Often, analysts do not know which variables should
interact. If there are, say, 50 variables, the possible number of
interactions is overwhelming.
- In small datasets (e.g., 100 people) it is easily possible there may
be more variables then people. GLMs require that the sample size be
larger then the number of predictors, making them a poor choice for MI
in these cases.

We do not discuss it here, but many of these limitations can be
addressed using alternate prediction models, especially in machine
learning.

Once multiple imputed datasets are generated, the previously discussed
steps are performed. The analysis of interest is run on each dataset
to generate estimates for the parameters of interest, $\hat{Q}$ and
standard errors and these are combined (pooled) to generate an overall
estimate and an uncertainty estimate that accounts for sampling
variation, missing data uncertainty, and simulation error from finite
number of imputed datasets. These are then reported as usual
(estimate, standard error, confidence interval, p-value, etc.).

## MI in `R` 

Before we can try MI in `R` we need to make a dataset with missing
values. It is possible to do multilevel imputation, but it is more
complicated and outside the scope of this lecture.
To begin with, we will make a single level dataset. For the sake of
example, we will take only complete data and then add missing data
ourselves. This allows us to compare different approaches with the
"truth" from the non-missing data.

The code below is not important to understand. It just creates three
datasets:

1. The raw daily diary dataset we've worked with
2. A complete case, between person dataset with no missing values.
3. A between person dataset with missing values

```{r}

## read in the dataset
d <- readRDS("aces_daily_sim_processed.RDS")

## between person data, no missing
davg <- na.omit(d[, .(
  Female = factor(na.omit(Female)[1], levels = 0:1),
  Age = na.omit(Age)[1],
  STRESS = mean(STRESS, na.rm = TRUE),
  PosAff = mean(PosAff, na.rm = TRUE),
  NegAff = mean(NegAff, na.rm = TRUE)),
  by = UserID])

## create missing data
davgmiss <- copy(davg)
davgmiss[STRESS < 1, NegAff := NA]
davgmiss[STRESS > 4, PosAff := NA]
## random missingness on age
set.seed(1234)
davgmiss[, Age := ifelse(rbinom(
             .N, size = 1, prob = .1) == 1,
             NA, Age)]
## drop unneeded variables to make analysis easier
davgmiss[, UserID := NULL]

```

Before doing any imputation, it is a good idea to examine data. The
`VIM` package in `R` has helpful functions for exploring missing
data. We start by looking at the amount missing on each variable and
the patterns of missing data using the `aggr()` function. This shows
us that just over half of cases have complete data on all variables.

```{r}

aggr(davgmiss, prop = TRUE,
     numbers = TRUE)

```

A margin plot is an augmented scatter plot that in the margins shows
the values on one variable when missing on the other along with a
boxplot. This shows us that when negative affect is missing, stress
scores are all low between 0 and 1. There are no missing stress scores
so there is only one boxplot for negative affect.

```{r}

marginplot(davgmiss[,.(STRESS, NegAff)])

``` 

We can test whether levels of one variable differ by missing on
another variable. This is often done with simple analyses, like
t-tests or chi-square tests.

```{r}

## does stress differ by missing on negative affect?
t.test(STRESS ~ is.na(NegAff), data = davgmiss)

## does stress differ by missing on positive affect?
t.test(STRESS ~ is.na(PosAff), data = davgmiss)

## does age differ by missing on negative affect?
t.test(Age ~ is.na(NegAff), data = davgmiss)

## does age differ by missing on positive affect?
t.test(Age ~ is.na(PosAff), data = davgmiss)

chisq.test(davgmiss$Female, is.na(davgmiss$PosAff))
chisq.test(davgmiss$Female, is.na(davgmiss$NegAff))

```

Actually conducting MI in `R` is relatively straight forward. A very
flexible, robust approach is available using the `mice` package and
the `mice()` function. You can control almost every aspect of the MI
in `mice()` but you also can use defaults.

`mice()` takes a dataset, the number of imputed datasets to generate,
the number of iterations, the random seed (make it reproducible) and
default imputation methods. The defaults are fine, but you can change
default imputation methods. Below we ask for all GLMs:

1. "norm" which is linear regression for numeric data
2. "logreg" which is logistic regression for factor data with 2 levels
3. "polyreg" which is polytomous or multinomial regression for
   unordered factor data with 3+ levels
4. "polr" ordered logistic regression for factor data with 3+ ordered
   levels

`R` will do the steps discussed to then generate imputed datasets.
We plot them to see if there is evidence of convergence. From 3
iterations, it may be too few to see evidence of convergence.

```{r}

mi.1 <- mice(
  davgmiss,
  m = 5,   maxit = 3,
  defaultMethod = c("norm", "logreg", "polyreg", "polr"),
  seed = 1234, printFlag = FALSE)

## plot convergence diagnostics
plot(mi.1, PosAff + NegAff + Age ~ .it | .ms)

```

If we are not convinced the model converged, re-run with more
iterations. Convergence is when there is no clear systematic change
with additional iterations.

```{r}

## run an additional iterations
mi.1 <- mice.mids(
  mi.1, maxit = 20,
  printFlag = FALSE)


## plot convergence diagnostics
plot(mi.1, PosAff + NegAff + Age ~ .it | .ms)

```

Once we are satisfied with convergence, we can plot the imputed data
versus observed data. Imputed data are in red.

```{r}

densityplot(mi.1, ~ PosAff + NegAff + Age)

xyplot(mi.1, NegAff + PosAff ~ STRESS)

```

Once you have created the imputed datasets, you can analyse
them. Recall that analyses must be repeated on each individual
dataset. For models that are fitted with a formula interface, you can
use the special `with()` function which works with multiply imputed
datasets. It means that the analysis is automatically run on each
imputed dataset separately. If we view the results, we end up with a
bunch of separate linear regressions.
To pool the results from the individual regressions, we use the
`pool()` function[^pooloutput].

[^pooloutput]: The pooled output has several pieces:
**estimate**: the pooled, average regression coefficients;
**ubar**: the average variance (based on the squared standard errors)
associated with sampling variation, we called it $\bar{V}$; 
**b**: the between imputation variance; 
**t**: the total variance incorporating sampling variation, between
imputation variance, and simulation error;
**dfcom**: the degrees of freedom for the complete data analysis (i.e.,
if there had not been missing data);
**df**: the estimated residual degrees of freedom for the model, taking
into account missingness;
**riv**: the relative increase variance due to missing data;
**lambda** or $\lambda$: the proportion of total variance due to
missing data, that is: $\lambda = \frac{B + B/m}{T}$;
**fmi**: the fraction of missing information

```{r}

mi.reg <- with(mi.1, lm(NegAff ~ PosAff + Age))

mi.reg

pool(mi.reg)

```

We can also summarise the pooled results with confidence intervals
using the `summary()` function on the pooled results[^summaryoutput].
Finally, we can get a pooled $R^2$ value using the
`pool.r.squared()` function on the analyses.

[^summaryoutput]: The summary output includes standard regression
output in this case.
**estimate**: the pooled, average regression coefficients;
**std.error**: the standard error of the estimates incorporating all
three sources of MI error, specifically: $se = \sqrt{T}$;
**statistic**: $\frac{estimate}{std.error}$;
**df**: the estimated degrees of freedom incorporating uncertainty due
to missing data, combined with the statistic to calculate p-values;
**p.value**: the p-value, the probability of obtaining the estimate or
larger in the sample given that the true population value was zero.
**2.5%**: the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval;
**97.5%**: the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval.

```{r}

m.mireg <- summary(pool(mi.reg), conf.int=TRUE)
print(m.mireg)

pool.r.squared(mi.reg)

```

In general, you can use any analysis you want with multiple
imputation, replacing `lm()` with another function, including `lmer()`
as we've worked with this semester.

## Multiple Imputation Comparison

One thing that often is helpful is to compare results under different
models or assumptions. The code that follows is a bit complicated
(don't worry, you don't need to use it yourself), and is used to fit
the same model in three ways:

1. pooled from the multiple imputations that was already done,
   labelled "MI Reg".
2. based on the true, non-missing data, since we made the missing data
ourselves and have the true data, labelled, "Truth".
3. Complete case analysis using listwise deletion, labelled "CC".

The graph that follows shows that compared to the true data, the
multiply imputed results have larger confidence intervals slightly. In
this case, the multiply imputed results are closer to the truth in the
absolute estimates (dots in the graph) than are the estimates from the
complete case analysis.

```{r}
m.true <- lm(NegAff ~ PosAff + Age, data = davg)
m.cc <- lm(NegAff ~ PosAff + Age, data = davgmiss)

res.true <- as.data.table(cbind(coef(m.true), confint(m.true)))
res.cc <- as.data.table(cbind(coef(m.cc), confint(m.cc)))
res.mireg <- as.data.table(m.mireg[, c("estimate", "2.5 %", "97.5 %")])
setnames(res.true, c("B", "LL", "UL"))
setnames(res.cc, c("B", "LL", "UL"))
setnames(res.mireg, c("B", "LL", "UL"))

res.compare <- rbind(
  cbind(Type = "Truth", Param = names(coef(m.true)), res.true),
  cbind(Type = "CC", Param = names(coef(m.true)), res.cc),
  cbind(Type = "MI Reg", Param = names(coef(m.true)), res.mireg))

ggplot(res.compare, aes(factor(""),
   y = B, ymin = LL, ymax = UL, colour = Type)) +
  geom_pointrange(position = position_dodge(.4)) +
  facet_wrap(~Param, scales = "free")

```
